brew install ant

# Linux
sudo apt-get install ant
```

### Build and run dev version (Non minified and debug ON)

Plug your device in if you have one (make sure your device is listed by running: ```$ adb devices```) or let Android emulator handle it.

```
# Dump dev files within the www folder and run android in debug mode
npm run android
```

If your device is connected and in USB mode you will see your application that you can inspect using Chrome dev tools.

### Build and run on device dev version (Non minified and debug ON)

For details about various requirements to deploy to a device, refer to the Cordova article: [Getting Started with iOS](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/2.5.0/guide_getting-started_ios_index.md.html). Briefly, you need to do the following before deploying:

1. Join the Apple iOS Developer Program.
1. Generate a certificate http://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/servlet/hwiki?Create+a+Certificate+Signing+Request+in+a+MAC,
1. Create a Provisioning Profile within the [iOS Provisioning Portal](https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/overview/index.action). You can use its Development Provisioning Assistant to create and install the profile and certificate Xcode requires.
1. Verify that the Code Signing section's Code Signing Identity within the project settings is set to your provisioning profile name.

```
# Dump dev files within the www folder and run iOS in debug mode
npm run ios
```

```
